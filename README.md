SUMMARY:

In this assignment we were asked to create a coding quiz using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Most of the work for this application is done in the JavaScript file, as that is where the quiz questions, timer, and highscores are generated. A key point of this assignment was the idea of using local storage to store running table of highscores on the page. By using local storage, we are able to keep the high score values even when the page is refreshed.
